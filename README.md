# 👋 Hi, I'm **Yihao Luo**
### PhD Student @ Imperial College London 
**3D Geometry • Reconstruction Algorithms • Generative Models**

---

## 🚀 About Me  
I work on **high-fidelity 3D representations**, **differentiable geometric pipelines**, and **geometry-aware neural networks**.  
My research spans:

- 🧩 **3D reconstruction & mesh generation**  
- 📐 **Geometric processing, topology, and curvature analysis**  
- 💠 **Hybrid 3D representations (meshes, voxels, SDF/UDF, sparse structures)**  
- 🚀 **Large-scale 3D generative models** 

My goal is to build **accurate, scalable, and mathematically grounded** methods for 3D understanding and generation.

🎓 With a strong foundation in **modern geometry, topology, and applied mathematics**, I explore how mathematical structure can guide the next generation of 3D geometric intelligence.

📚 If you're working on **3D AI, geometry processing, or next-gen generative models**, I’m always open to new ideas and collaborations.
