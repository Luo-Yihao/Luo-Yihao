- 👋 Hi, here is @Luo-Yihao. I am a PhD student in Bioengineering at Imperial College London, specializing in the development of deep learning algorithms for medical image reconstructions and biomechanics simulations.
- 👀 My current research interests focus on self-supervised networks for 3D computer vision combined with physical and geometrical guidance.
- 🌱 With a professional background in mathematics, particularly in modern geometry and topology, I am passionate about exploring the intersection and balance between pure mathematics and intelligent science.
- 💞️ My work has been published in top-tier conferences and journals, and I am actively seeking new research opportunities and collaborations. I am open to exploring new and interesting projects, so please feel free to contact me if you have anything in mind.
- 📫 My email: y.luo23@imperial.ac.uk, yihaoluo2020@gmail.com
